# CrackTech - Get LeetCode Company Tags 

## CrackTech (previously *LeetCode Which Company*) gives you the information of the companies who asked a certain question in the technical interview.
---
Are you preparing for your technical interviews? Are you looking for the question asked by companies like Microsoft, Google, Meta, Apple, etc.? Then this extension gives you what you are looking for.

This extension is my effort to make your preparation one step better. If you are solving problems on Leetcode and you do not have a premium account to see company information then I am definite that this extension will give you the same experience to some extent. You can prepare for your dream companies and sharpen your DSA skill accordingly.

However, since I am continuously updating company information solely, you might not get company information for every single problem as you can find in Leetcode premium. I collect company information from different sources on the internet and update it in my database. So in some cases, you might get **some more company information** than Leetcode provides.

Install this extension/add-on and boost your prep. Wishing you all the very best in your journey.

------ 
## How this extension is different from existing others - 

- Regular updates on company information.
- Addition of new company information for problems almost everyday.
- Company based problem list at a glance.
- A pop-up window extension. No garbage, just the content you needed.
- Flexible to LeetCode UI changes. So no downtime on your preparation.
- No data collection.

    - Once you click on the **[All Company]** button it will open up a page where you can see all the problems available in our storage with company names are listed as follows - ![all company](/static/webfile/complete_list.png)


- If the extension is not able to find the `Company Names` for the leetcode problem on the current window or if the current window is not a leetcode problem then it will show a **Company information not found** message.


- If the extension is clicked on a `non-leetcode` site then it will show a **Not a LeetCode site** message.
